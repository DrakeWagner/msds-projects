### *Disaster Relief Project*
(disaster_relief_proj.Rmd)<p>
 
 The goal of this project was to use various classification methods to solve a real historical data-mining problem: locating displaced persons living in makeshift shelters following the destruction of the earthquake in Haiti in 2010. Following the earthquake, rescue workers, mostly from the United States military, needed to get food and water to the displaced persons. But with destroyed communications, impassable roads, and thousands of square miles, actually locating the people who needed help was challenging. As part of the rescue effort, a team from the Rochester Institute of Technology were flying an aircraft to collect high resolution geo-referenced imagery. It was known that the people whose homes had been destroyed by the earthquake were creating temporary shelters using blue tarps, and these blue tarps would be good indicators of where the displaced persons were. However, this situation was obviously time-sensitive, and there was no way that the thousands of images collected every day would be able to get thourougly searched by aid workers for the tarps, while also communicating the locations back to rescue workers on the ground. The solution would be provided by data-mining algorithms, which could search the images faster, more thouroughly, and potentially even more accurately than humanly possible. The goal was to find an algorithm that could effectively search the images in order to locate displaced persons and communicate those locations rescue workers so they could help those who needed it in time.
